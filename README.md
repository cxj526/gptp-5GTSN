# gptp-5GTSN
IEEE8201ASï¼ŒC++
This project aims at the implementation of gptp protocol.
The experimental environment was as follows
OMNET++ 5.6.2
INET 4.2.2
matters needing attention:
First, design and implement gptp protocol for inet4. X. although some people have implemented gptp of inet3.6 before, it is too long, so we re implemented gptp of 4. X.
Second: this project is recommended as a reference, focusing on the design ideas. For OMNeT + + novices, they can learn to use it while referring to the project.
Third: the project is not perfect, more is to provide a framework.
Fourth: if there is no requirement for 5g, it is recommended to use OMNeT + + 6.0 and the latest version of INET.
